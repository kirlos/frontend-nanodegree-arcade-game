==============================

**This is intended to be a simplified version of the game "frogger"**

## How to run

Open index.html in your preferred browser. The game should start immediately upon loading. Game functionality has been tested in Chrome and Firefox

# How to play

### Movement
The player is moved using the arrow keys.
### Goal
The player will start at the bottom of the screen in the middle. The object of the game is to move the player across the screen to the blue blocks at the top, while avoiding the bugs cruising across.
### Scoring
Once the player successfully makes it to the top of the screen, 100 points will be added to the score and player will return to the start to try again for another 100 points. Each time the player scores the bugs will move a little faster.
### Lives
If the player contacts a bug, a life will be lost and the player will return to the start. If all three lives are lost, the score will be reset and a new game begins.
